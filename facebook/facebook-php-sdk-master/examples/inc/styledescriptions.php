$chinoisieresdes = "Chinoiserie has taken on many forms since the 17th century and my own chinoiserie images grew from a desire to engage this genre outside traditional formulas. 
    The fantasy of chinoiserie has been one of its most enduring characteristics, and at age twelve I became hooked. My father, who was also an artist, showed me a book of 
    designs in his studio by the itinerant French painter, Jean Pillement, who specialized in chinoiserie subjects in the 18th century. Pillement traversed much of Europe 
    painting murals, screens, and panels for aristocratic clients that had an insatiable appetite for his work. I enjoy working on a modest scale and the modern era has left 
    room to reinterpret chinoiserie in an informal way that continues to offer a lot of unexplored possibilities. Chinoiserie has never really gone fully out of style, and 
    will likely continue to inspire the imaginations of people discovering its appeal as long as artists strive to keep their interpretation of it original as a genre in 
    ways that reflect their own time.";

$flowerstitle = "Flower Ladies and Shell People";
$flowersdes = "Fantasy manifests itself in many areas of artistic creation and anthropomorphic human figures that combine the attributes of animals or 
plants have a long history that has been distinctly inspirational for me.  Frequently I have been asked if my paintings are built around a narrative that 
I have imagined and the answer is generally yes. In some cases there may be a much more complete story than the painting depicts and in other instances a 
painting may be just a fragment of a story with no clear beginning or end for me.  In my view it is unnecessary to fully understand every image we see and every 
story or poem we read because it is like trying to analyze why we enjoy a beautiful day, and it is better to simply enjoy it. No matter how well we think we understand or 
can explain a form of art, there likely remains something that escapes definition. The images in this area of the website are sometimes tongue in cheek, and I prefer to focus
on subjects that I find uplifting. I have gotten the habit of referring to the female figures with flowers sprouting from their heads as “flower ladies”.";                                                                                                                                                           

$gardenstitle = "Gardens";
$gardensdes = "Garden history goes hand in hand with the history of art and architecture and there are few people that do not enjoy the pleasure of walking or sitting in a beautiful 
garden. Gardens not only remind us of our connection to nature but they have been the subject of fantasy and artistic creation for centuries and have inspired countless writers, 
painters and musicians. My own paintings that connect to garden themes are a limited representation of the imagery that the subject of gardens evokes for me.  In the time ahead 
I look forward to adding work to this category of prints.";

$shellstitle = "Shells";
$shellsdes = "Shells have fascinated people since at least the beginning of recorded history and my own interest started as a child scavenging on the beaches of Prouts Neck. 
Shells are among the many forms of nature that take on shapes, colors, and patterns that challenge all credibility, and as a teenager I accumulated a large enough collection to turn to 
them as a subject for numerous paintings. The prints on this website were created from paintings either on calligraphic pages from early 19th century copy books used by school children 
for arithmetic and penmanship, or romantic albums in which adults recorded poetry.  The calligraphic sheets were an inviting surface on which to paint, and once I got over the reluctance 
to use them in a way that seemed destructive to antique documents, they have proven very popular with many people that have bought my work.";
